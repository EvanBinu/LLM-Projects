# 🧠 LLM Projects Repository

Welcome to the **LLM Projects Repository** — a curated collection of practical projects and experiments exploring the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This repository is built to help you understand, apply, and experiment with modern LLMs like **GPT**, **LLaMA**, **T5**, **Falcon**, and more using tools like **Hugging Face Transformers**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI APIs**.

Whether you're building chatbots, RAG-based systems, prompt engineering workflows, or exploring fine-tuning strategies, you'll find examples and blueprints here to accelerate your learning.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- ✅ Real-world LLM use cases implemented in Python
- ⚙️ Pre-trained and fine-tuned models for text generation, summarization, Q&A, and more
- 🌐 OpenAI, Hugging Face, and local model integration
- 🧠 Experiments with prompt engineering, LangChain agents, and RAG architecture
- 🛠️ Hands-on scripts ready for customization

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
